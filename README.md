<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Draft makes it easier for developers to get started building apps that run on Kubernetes by taking a non-containerized application and generating the Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize configuration, and other artifacts associated with a containerized application. Draft can also generate a GitHub Action workflow file to quickly build and deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster.

### Commands

* `draft create` adds the minimum required Dockerfile and manifest files for your deployment to the project directory.
  * Supported deployment types: Helm, Kustomize, Kubernetes manifest.
* `draft setup-gh` automates the Github OIDC setup process for your project.
* `draft generate-workflow` generates a Github Action workflow for automatic build and deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
* `draft update` automatically make your application to be internet accessible.

Use `draft [command] --help` for more information about a command.
