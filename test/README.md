# Integration Test

To generate integration tests put all relevant information in the `integration_config.json` file. Then run the `gen_integration.sh` script to autogenerate the workflow and configs. You must have jq installed to run this.

Edit the `gen_integration.sh` script to make any changes to how integration tests are written. The `test/integration` folder and `.github/workflows/integration.yml` file are autogenerated so manual changes to them will be overwritten.
